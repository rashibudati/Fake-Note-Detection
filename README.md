# Fake-Note-Detection
Built a Deep Learning model using Keras. used an input layer, 2 hidden layers and an output layer. The highest accuracy I achieved by training the data was 92.85%


Required libraries:
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Numpy
4. Scikit-learn, Scikitplot
5. Matplotlib
6. Gensim
7. Python 3.5

To Run:

```
python T1.py

```
